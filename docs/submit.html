Articles must be given a thumbnail image URL. We suggest using a google drive link set to public access. Keep in mind that articles are downloaded and put in the code, so use your own image. The category must represent the content of the article.</p><br><h4>First article</h4><p>When your first articles is approved, it will be published on the website.

This is an optional step and you can always change your mind later.</p><br><h4>Next articles</h4><p>When your first article is approved, you can submit more articles. We will review each article before publishing it.

These websites are required to add your name as the author. The GDN can edit any article at any point. You will be notified when this happens. You can always ask for your article to be removed.</p><br><h4>Contact</h4><p>If you have any questions about submitting articles, please contact us. We will be happy to help you.</p>
