    <h2>About us</h2>
 <p>Hi! I'm Siebe Cluyts, aka FireFaults. I realized there are not much ways to find the latest news of GD, so I created this simple site. The site is build for people that want to know what is happening in the community. The site does not have any ads, and that is what makes this site diffrent then anything else. Our team is just a few players who realized just like me that this is what is needed in the community. I thank everybody on this website for using our site. Feel free to send us a message or request an article, because that is what we like! Have fun on our website!</p>
          <a href="contact">Contact</a>
          <br>
          <p>Our site is fully free, so donations are accepted!
          </p>
