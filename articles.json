The player Danielcookie was seen as the best mobile gd player, and he said he beat Nullscapes very easy. This grew some suspision on his friend who made a copy of Danielcookie's level and it was just too easy, like something felt wrong. The friend whent in the editor and found a lot of invisable option triggers under the level.<br>There are also some other hackers. CookieIsMine was seen as one of the best players in Nullscapes, but it was later found he was playing 'Nullscapes hold'. He confessed to doing this on Twitter on 16 October 2025, after the Demonlist moderators supposedly forced him to, because he had been posting fake progress on his Twitter account. On top of that, his Pointecrate account has been banned for three months. CookieIsMine also provided that Secret Way's video about his notable progress made him feel guilty, causing him to make his faked runs more obvious, and finally playing the level with an Elmo costume. Despite faking his runs, CookieIsMine has made legitimate progress on the level of 44-80% and 63-100%, saying that he really wants to beat the level in the future."},
