This level is also very hard and is currently the hardest level in the game according to the demonlist, surpasing the former hardest level Amethyst. The level got rated after Zoink verified it on 25 may 2025, the same day Amethyst got verified. Amethyst got rated almost instantly by robtop but Thinking Space II took a long time to get rated. Many people are happy that this level finally got rated becouse according to Zoink and a lot of other players Thinking Space II is a harder level than Amethyst."
