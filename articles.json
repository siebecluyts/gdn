    "content": "On July 18, RobTop Games announced the Random Gauntlet Contest. However, the Gauntlet textures for this contest are not currently in the game. This means that Geometry Dash 2.21 might release on November 16, 2025. This means that 2.21 would also include the Gauntlet sprites for the Random Gauntlet Contest. <br> This could get delayed and it probably is gonna happen becouse robtop is not that good at giving release dates."
